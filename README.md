## About the Project

This is my personal developer portfolio, built with **React** (via **Vite**) for fast development and smooth performance.  
It serves as a platform to showcase **projects**, **skills**, and **contact details** with a clean and modern design.

## Customization Ideas

- Add social media links (GitHub, LinkedIn, Twitter)

- Implement light/dark mode toggle
- Use animations (e.g., smooth scrolling, entrance effects)
- Enhance accessibility with proper aria attributes and keyboard navigation
